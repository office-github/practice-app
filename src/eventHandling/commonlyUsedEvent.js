//If you arenâ€™t using class fields syntax as used in toggle.js, you can use an arrow function in the callback:

import React from 'react'

class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
    handleClick() {
        console.log('this is:', this);
    }

    render() {
        // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick
        return (
            <button onClick={(e) => this.handleClick(e)}>
                Click me
      </button>
        );
    }
}

export default LoggingButton;

// Note: The problem with this syntax is that a different callback is created each time the LoggingButton renders.
// In most cases, this is fine. However, if this callback is passed as a prop to lower components, those components might do an extra re - rendering.
// We generally recommend binding in the constructor or using the class fields syntax, to avoid this sort of performance problem.
